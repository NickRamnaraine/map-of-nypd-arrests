# map-of-nypd-arrests
I created a map of arrests in Python using Pandas, Folium, and GeoPandas. It contains detailed information about the arrests that happen on a day that you pick for the beginning of 2024.

This map uses data from the [data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nypd-arrest-data-year-to-date) website, it contains the arrests data for the program. It only contained the data from 2024-01-01 and 2024-03-31.
